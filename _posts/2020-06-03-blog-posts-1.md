# Proxygen source code review
Source code review of Proxygen, a C++ HTTP library.

## Interfaces and how to use them
[Proxygen](https://github.com/facebook/proxygen) is Facebook's C++ HTTP libraries. The basic components are `HTTPServer`, `RequestHandlerFactory`, and `RequestHandler` under the `/proxygen/httpserver` directory.

The official version has incorporated sample usage, which is under `/proxygen/httpserver/samples/` and it includes echo, and static http server samples.

I would like to take `static` server as an example. The `main()` function is in `StaticServer.cpp`. It first initializes `folly` and IP configs. Then you should define the `options` structure. `handlerFactories` is important in `options`.
```
options.handlerFactories = RequestHandlerChain()
      .addThen<StaticHandlerFactory>()
      .build();
```
The `StaticHandlerFactory` class is implemented by user in `StaticServer.cpp`, and it returns a new static handler. Every specific handler factory should inherit `RequestHandlerFactory`, which is a virtual class that defines some interfaces. 
```
class StaticHandlerFactory : public RequestHandlerFactory {
 public:
  void onServerStart(folly::EventBase* /*evb*/) noexcept override {}

  void onServerStop() noexcept override {}

  RequestHandler* onRequest(RequestHandler*, HTTPMessage*) noexcept override {
    return new StaticHandler;
  }
};

```
The role of handler in the whole system is that, it is attached with each request, and interacts with operation system, or upstream servers requested by the clients.

Then `options` and IPconfigs will be passed to the interfaces. Your simple static http server is completed!
```
HTTPServer server(std::move(options));
  server.bind(IPs);

  // Start HTTPServer mainloop in a separate thread
  std::thread t([&] () {
    server.start();
  });

  t.join();
  return 0;
```

## Introductions of each component
### HTTPServer
`HTTPServer.cpp` abstracts actions of server like start and stop. By using `bind()`, `codecFactory`, When starting a server, it first gets an event base to manage events in a thread pool. Most thread io, and event management in Proxygen are based on the `folly` library developed by Facebook. 

After getting an event base, it does following things in `startTcpServer()`:
1. Register `HandlerCallbacks` as the observer of thread pool. `HandlerCallbacks` implements interfaces like `threadStarted` and `threadStopped`. 
2. `AcceptorFactory` new a `HTTPServerAcceptor`, and pass it into `bootstrap_`.
3. `bootstrap_` sets `childHandler`, and thread pools for accepting connections and IO handling.

Then the server will start the main event loop.

### RequestHandler
`RequestHandler` is an abstract class and its interfaces are implemented by specific handlers like `staticHandler` to handle static requests. 

`ResponseHandler` acts as clients for `RequestHandler` subclasses and provides methods to send back the responses.

Methods of `RequestHandler` are registed as callback functions in `HTTPSession` module, to finish tasks in different stages. Some important methods include:
```
onRequest()
onBody()
onUpgrade()
onEOM()
onError()
```
#### RequestHandlerAdaptor
This class acts as an adaptor that converts `HTTPTransactionHandler` to `RequestHandler`. 
```
public:
  explicit RequestHandlerAdaptor(RequestHandler* requestHandler);
```
It implements two abstract classes: `HTTPTransactionHandler` and `ResponseHandler`. It can send response directly back to clients, or interacts with `Transport`.

## Overview of Proxygen architecture
The architecture of Proxygen is as [this picture](https://github.com/facebook/proxygen/blob/master/CoreProxygenArchitecture.png) in its official README shows. A complete diagram of how it processes a http request is in `HTTPTransaction.h`:
```
/**
 * An HTTPTransaction represents a single request/response pair
 * for some HTTP-like protocol.  It works with a Transport that
 * performs the network processing and wire-protocol formatting
 * and a Handler that implements some sort of application logic.
 *
 * The typical sequence of events for a simple application is:
 *
 *   * The application accepts a connection and creates a Transport.
 *   * The Transport reads from the connection, parses whatever
 *     protocol the client is speaking, and creates a Transaction
 *     to represent the first request.
 *   * Once the Transport has received the full request headers,
 *     it creates a Handler, plugs the handler into the Transaction,
 *     and calls the Transaction's onIngressHeadersComplete() method.
 *   * The Transaction calls the Handler's onHeadersComplete() method
 *     and the Handler begins processing the request.
 *   * If there is a request body, the Transport streams it through
 *     the Transaction to the Handler.                               
 *   * When the Handler is ready to produce a response, it streams
 *     the response through the Transaction to the Transport.
 *   * When the Transaction has seen the end of both the request
 *     and the response, it detaches itself from the Handler and
 *     Transport and deletes itself.
 *   * The Handler deletes itself at some point after the Transaction
 *     has detached from it.
 *   * The Transport may, depending on the protocol, process other
 *     requests after -- or even in parallel with -- that first
 *     request.  Each request gets its own Transaction and Handler.
 *
 * For some applications, like proxying, a Handler implementation
 * may obtain one or more upstream connections, each represented
 * by another Transport, and create outgoing requests on the upstream
 * connection(s), with each request represented as a new Transaction.
 *
 * With a multiplexing protocol like SPDY on both sides of a proxy,
 * the cardinality relationship can be:
 *
 *                 +-----------+     +-----------+     +-------+
 *   (Client-side) | Transport |1---*|Transaction|1---1|Handler|
 *                 +-----------+     +-----------+     +-------+
 *                                                         1
 *                                                         |
 *                                                         |
 *                                                         1
 *                                   +---------+     +-----------+
 *                (Server-side)      |Transport|1---*|Transaction|
 *                                   +---------+     +-----------+
 *
 * A key design goal of HTTPTransaction is to serve as a protocol-
 * independent abstraction that insulates Handlers from the semantics
 * different of HTTP-like protocols.

```


## From starting listening to new connections coming in

In last section, I introduced several components to build a simple http server using Proxygen. I would like to explain what is happening behind those interfaces from starting listening to accepting new connections.

In the `main` function, we can configure our options and pass it into server. `options` has a list of `HandlerFactory` that can handle different events.
```
options.handlerFactories = RequestHandlerChain()
      .addThen<StaticHandlerFactory>()
      .build();
```

`AcceptorFactory` accepts `HandlerFactory` as the parameter of its constructor.
```
// AcceptorFactory
auto factory = std::make_shared<AcceptorFactory>(
          options_, // include HandlerFactory
          codecFactory,
          accConfig,
          sessionInfoCb_);
```

Then a `bootstrap` is started. `bootstrap` is in the `wangle` library. What `bootstrap` does here are mainly completed by three functions:
```
bootstrap_[i].childHandler(factory);
bootstrap_[i].group(accExe, exe); 
bootstrap_[i].bind(addresses_[i].address);
```

`bootstrap.group()` sets the thread pool for acception and IO. In `group()`, `AcceptorFactory` will new an acceptor and binds it with a new thread pool through `newAcceptor(eventBase)` in `wangle::threadStarted()`.

In `bind()`, new `asynServerSocket` is built by `newSocket()` of `socketFactory`. Asynchronous callback function for accepting new connections is binded with `asynServerSocket`, and thread is set with it:
```
socketFactory -> addAcceptCB(socket, worker, worker -> getEventBase());
```

After a new connection coming in, `acceptCB()` will be called and several functions in `wangle` will be executed. The last function is `onNewConnection()` in `HTTPServerAcceptor`.

In Proxygen, `HTTPServerAcceptor::onNewConnection()` will call `HTTPSessionAcceptor::onNewConnection()`. In this function, new session is started:
```
session -> setSessionStats(downStreamSessionStats_);
Acceptor::addConnection(session);
session -> StartNow();
```

## Handle a HTTP request
When a new HTTP request is read in, Proxygen uses an external HTTP parser library to parse it, and save it as a `HTTPMessage` object. The HTTP parser it uses is based on the parser used by Nginx.

`HTTPCodec` implements the callback functions defined in the http parser library. `onIngress()` is the first function of `HTTPCodec` to be called. It starts parsing the message by 
```
size_t bytesParsed = http_parser_execute(&parser_,
                                             getParserSettings(),
                                             (const char*)buf.data(),
                                             buf.length());
```
Callback functions are set in `getParserSettings()`, and those functions are called when `http_parser_execute()` is called. Please be sure that all of the callback functions should return 0 when successed and return 1 when failed. Unexpected errors might happen if the return values are misdefined.
```
const http_parser_settings* HTTP1xCodec::getParserSettings() {
  static http_parser_settings parserSettings = [] {
    http_parser_settings st;
    st.on_message_begin = HTTP1xCodec::onMessageBeginCB;
    st.on_url = HTTP1xCodec::onUrlCB;
    st.on_header_field = HTTP1xCodec::onHeaderFieldCB;
    st.on_header_value = HTTP1xCodec::onHeaderValueCB;
    st.on_headers_complete = HTTP1xCodec::onHeadersCompleteCB;
    st.on_body = HTTP1xCodec::onBodyCB;
    st.on_message_complete = HTTP1xCodec::onMessageCompleteCB;
    st.on_reason = HTTP1xCodec::onReasonCB;
    st.on_chunk_header = HTTP1xCodec::onChunkHeaderCB;
    st.on_chunk_complete = HTTP1xCodec::onChunkCompleteCB;
    return st;
  }();
  return &parserSettings;
}
```

The functions `on...()` in `HTTPSession` will also be called in the functions of `HTTPCodec`. The diagram is as followed:
```
HTTP1xCodec::onHeadersComplete() -> HTTPSession::onHeadersComplete() -> HTTPDownstreamSession::setupOnHeadersComplete()
```

In `HTTPSession`, a new controller is allocated by calling `HTTPSessionBase::getController()`. In `HTTPDownstreamSession`, a new handler is created by the controller, by calling `acceptor_ -> newHandler()`, and is attached to a `HTTPTransaction` by calling 
```
handler = SimpleController::getRequestHandler();
Transaction -> setHandler(handler);
```

In `newHandler()` of `HTTPServerAcceptor`, each `HandlerFactory`'s `onRequest()` will be called, and a new `RequestHandlerAdaptor` is returned;
```
HTTPTransactionHandler* HTTPServerAcceptor::newHandler(
    HTTPTransaction& txn,
    HTTPMessage* msg) noexcept {

  SocketAddress clientAddr, vipAddr;
  txn.getPeerAddress(clientAddr);
  txn.getLocalAddress(vipAddr);
  msg->setClientAddress(clientAddr);
  msg->setDstAddress(vipAddr);

  // Create filters chain
  RequestHandler* h = nullptr;
  for (auto& factory: handlerFactories_) {
    h = factory->onRequest(h, msg);
  }

  return new RequestHandlerAdaptor(h);
}
```

`RequestHandlerAdaptor` will interact with `ResponseHandler` and send responses to clients.
